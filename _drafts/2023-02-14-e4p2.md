#### Exercise 4: Pair of Plants (Part 1)
Create a brand and Valentine’s Day themed packaging for you and your partner’s succulent holder. You will come up with a name, visual design, and package. The container for your succulent holders should be assembled cleanly and nicely with the visual design on it (not a prototype but a more finished package). The brand is a brick and mortar store that sells indoor plants and related items. They also offer themed holiday gift sets, which is what you are designing.

##### Things to Keep in Mind
* How do you get the visual design onto the package?
* The brand is not necessarily Valentine’s Day themed, just the package
* The package would be purchased in store
* Plants need light

##### Objectives
* Creating a more polished final package
* Working with a partner
* Improving 2-D and 3-D design skills

##### Requirements
* Physical package that holds both containers with succulents
* Visual design on package
* Name of store & product
* Image(s) on blackboard and miro
